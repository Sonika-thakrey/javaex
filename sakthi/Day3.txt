1) Define and give example for a static inner class
2) Give an example for Interfaces and Abstract classes
3) Explore dynamic binding with Animal classes
4) Create an inner class for a manager, which contains information about the manager. Use the
appropriate interfaces. Create an anonymous inner class for Tech. Members using the Session
(Build a class Emp, which contains details about
the employee and compile and run its instance))

1) Autoboxing/Unboxing -> Class  Compatability - type conversion
2) Abstract class , Interfaces, Inner class


Autoboxing

1) int to float
   int i=10
    float t = i ()Autoboxing t=10.00

    float to int

    float t= 20.23
    int i = (int) t // Unboxing
